# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## 1. Software enginners who will work and invest in public image by:

1.1.
 Accept full responsibility for your own work.

1.2.
 Moderate the interests of the software engineer, the employer, the client and the users with the public good.

1.3. 
 Approve software only if they have a well-founded belief that it is safe, meets specifications, passes appropriate tests, and does not diminish quality of life, diminish privacy or harm the environment. The ultimate effect of the work should be to the public good.

1.4. 
 Disclose to appropriate persons or authorities any actual or potential danger to the user, the public, or the environment, that they reasonably believe to be associated with software or related documents.

1.5. 
 Cooperate in efforts to address matters of grave public concern caused by software, its installation, maintenance, support or documentation.

1.6. 
 Be fair and avoid deception in all statements, particularly public ones, concerning software or related documents, methods and tools.

1.7. 
Consider issues of physical disabilities, allocation of resources, economic disadvantage and other factors that can diminish access to the benefits of software.

1.8.
Be encouraged to volunteer professional skills to good causes and contribute to public education concerning the discipline.

1.9.
Be inclusive, considerate and respectful.

## 2. Choose your words carefully.
Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others.

## 3. Make differences into strenghts.
We can find strength in diversity. Different people have different perspectives on issues, and that can be valuable for solving problems or generating new ideas. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that we all make mistakes, and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere.
